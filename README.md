This notebook demonstrates how to perform neural style transfer using the VGG-19 pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Neural style transfer is a technique that allows you to apply the style of one image to another image.

Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need the following dependencies:

Numpy (version 1.21.2 or later)
Pandas (version 1.3.4 or later)
Os (version 2.3.5 or later)
TensorFlow (version 2.7.0 or later)
Keras (version 2.7.0 or later)
PIL (version 7.4.0 or later)
Matplotlib (version 3.5.1 or later)
Installation
You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:

Bash
pip install numpy pandas os tensorflow keras pillow matplotlib
Use code with caution. Learn more
Usage
To run the notebook, follow these steps:

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Download the content and style images you want to use.
Set the paths to the content and style images in the notebook.
Run the notebook cells.
The notebook will apply the style of the style image to the content image and display the result.

Examples
The notebook includes examples of how to use neural style transfer to apply the style of different paintings to different photographs.
